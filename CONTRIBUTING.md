# Contributing to pyfixest

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! We appreciate all contributions, from reporting bugs to implementing new features.

## Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

If you are new to open source / Python development, the fastest way to start contributing might be with **GitHub Codespaces**.
You start by forking the repository. You can then launch a codespace by clicking

[![Open in Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-Codespaces-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/codespaces)

This will launch a github codespace (there is a free tier for 60h a month, thank you github!).

## Local Development

Please refer to the [contributing section](https://py-econometrics.github.io/pyfixest/contributing.html) of our documentation to get started with local development.

For a comprehensive overview of the codebase architecture and internals, check out the [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest). While not perfect and correct in all regards, we think it is a pretty good starting point to learn about the codebase!

We look forward to your contributions!
