# Contributing to pyfixest

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! We appreciate all contributions, from reporting bugs to implementing new features.

## Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

The fastest way to start contributing is with GitHub Codespaces - no local setup required!

1. Click the green **Code** button on the repository
2. Select the **Codespaces** tab
3. Click **Create codespace on master**

The codespace will automatically install all dependencies, compile the Rust extension, and set up pre-commit hooks. Once ready (~7-10 min), you can immediately run tests with `pixi run tests-regular`.

## Local Development

Please refer to the [contributing section](https://py-econometrics.github.io/pyfixest/contributing.html) of our documentation to get started with local development.

For a comprehensive overview of the codebase architecture and internals, check out the [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest). While not perfect and correct in all regards, we think it is a pretty good starting point to learn about the codebase!

We look forward to your contributions!
