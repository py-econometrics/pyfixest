Thanks for taking the time to contribute! We appreciate all contributions, from reporting bugs to implementing new features.

Please refer to the [contributing section](https://py-econometrics.github.io/pyfixest/contributing.html) of our documentation to get started.

For a comprehensive overview of the codebase architecture and internals, check out the [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest). While not perfect and correct in all regards, we think it is a pretty good starting point to learn about the codebase!

We look forward to your contributions!
