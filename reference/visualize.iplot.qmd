# iplot

Plot model coefficients for variables interacted via "i()" syntax, with confidence intervals.
Args:
    models (list): A list of fitted models of type `Feols` or `Fepois`, or just a single model.
    figsize (tuple): The size of the figure.
    alpha (float): The significance level for the confidence intervals.
    yintercept (int or None): The value at which to draw a horizontal line on the plot.
    xintercept (int or None): The value at which to draw a vertical line on the plot.
    rotate_xticks (float): The angle in degrees to rotate the xticks labels. Default is 0 (no rotation).
    title (str): The title of the plot.
    coord_flip (bool): Whether to flip the coordinates of the plot. Default is True.
Returns:
    A lets-plot figure.
