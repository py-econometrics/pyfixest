| quantile         | float                                      | The quantile to estimate. Must be between 0 and 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `0.5`      |
| method           | QuantregMethodOptions                      | The method to use for the quantile regression. Currently, only "fn" is supported. In the future, will be either "fn" or "pfn". "fn" implements the Frisch-Newton interior point algorithm described in Portnoy and Koenker (1997). The "pfn" method implements a variant of the algorithm proposed by Portnoy and Koenker (1997) including preprocessing steps, which a) can speed up the algorithm if N is very large but b) assumes independent observations. For details, you can either take a look at the Portnoy and Koenker paper, or "Fast Algorithms for the Quantile Regression Process" by Chernozhukov, Fernández-Val, and Melly (2019). | `'fn'`     |
| multi_method     | QuantregMultiOptions                       | Controls the algorithm for running the quantile regression process. Only relevant if more than one quantile regression is fit in one `quantreg` call. Options are 'cmf1', which is the default and implements algorithm 2 from Chernozhukov et al, 'cmf2', which implements their algorithm 3, and 'none', which just loops over separate model calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `'cfm1'`   |
| tol              | float                                      | The tolerance for the algorithm. Defaults to 1e-06. As in R's quantreg package, the algorithm stops when the relative change in the duality gap is less than tol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `1e-06`    |
| maxiter          | int                                        | The maximum number of iterations. If None, maxiter = the number of observations in the model (as in R's quantreg package via nit(3) = n).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `None`     |
| vcov             | Union\[VcovTypeOptions, dict\[str, str\]\] | Type of variance-covariance matrix for inference. Currently supported are "iid", "nid", and cluster robust errors, "iid" by default. All of "iid", "hetero"and "cluster" robust error are based on a kernel-based estimator as in Powell (1991). The "nid" method implements the robust sandwich estimator proposed in Hendricks and Koenker (1993). Any of "HC1 / HC2 / HC3 also works and is equivalent to "hetero". Cluster robust inference following Parente and Santos Silva (2016) can be specified via a dictionary with the keys "type" and "cluster". Only one-way clustering is supported.                                                | `'nid'`    |
| ssc              | dict\[str, Union\[str, bool\]\]            | A dictionary specifying the small sample correction for inference. If None, uses default settings from `ssc_func()`. Note that by default, R's quantreg and Stata's qreg2 do not use small sample corrections. To match their behavior, set `ssc = pf.ssc(adj = False, cluster_adj = False)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `None`     |

However, it will no longer be possible to access the data via the `data` attribute of the model object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `True`     |
| lean             | bool                                       | False by default. If True, then all large objects are removed from the returned result: this will save memory but will block the possibility to use many methods. It is recommended to use the argument vcov to obtain the appropriate standard-errors at estimation time, since obtaining different SEs won't be possible afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `False`    |
| context          | int or Mapping\[str, Any\]                 | A dictionary containing additional context variables to be used by formulaic during the creation of the model matrix. This can include custom factorization functions, transformations, or any other variables that need to be available in the formula environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `None`     |
| split            | str                                        | A character string, i.e. 'split = var'. If provided, the sample is split according to the variable and one estimation is performed for each value of that variable. If you also want to include the estimation for the full sample, use the argument fsplit instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `None`     |
| fsplit           | str                                        | This argument is the same as split but also includes the full sample as the first estimation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `None`     |
| seed             | Optional\[int\]                            | A random seed for reproducibility. If None, no seed is set. Only relevant for the "pfn" method. The "fn" method is deterministic and does not require a seed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `None`     |

|        | object | An instance of the [Quantreg](/reference/estimation.quantreg.quantreg_.Quantreg.qmd) class or [FixestMulti](/reference/estimation.FixestMulti_.FixestMulti.qmd) class for multiple models specified via `fml`. |

## Examples {.doc-section .doc-section-examples}

The following example regresses `Y` on `X1` and `X2` at the median (0.5 quantile):

```{python}
import pyfixest as pf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

data = pf.get_data()

fit = pf.quantreg("Y ~ X1 + X2", data, quantile=0.5)
fit.summary()
```
