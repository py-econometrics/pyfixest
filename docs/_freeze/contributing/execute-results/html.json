We appreciate all\ncontributions and constructive feedback, whether that be reporting bugs, requesting\nnew features, or suggesting improvements to documentation.\n\nIf you'd like to get involved, but are not yet sure how, please feel free to send us an [email](alexander-fischer1801@t-online.de). Some familiarity with\neither Python or econometrics will help, but you really don't need to be a `numpy` core developer or have published in [Econometrica](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680262) =) We'd be more than happy to invest time to help you get started!\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## PyFixest Sprint in Heilbronn\n\nWe're hosting a [PyFixest Sprint](pyfixest-sprint.md) with [AppliedAI](https://www.appliedai.de/) in late February/early March 2026. If you're interested in contributing to PyFixest in person, [learn more and get in touch](pyfixest-sprint.md)!\n:::\n\nFor a comprehensive overview of the codebase architecture and internals, check out the [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest). While not perfect and correct in all regards, we think it is a pretty good starting point to learn about the codebase!\n\n## Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces\n\nIf you are new to open source / Python development, the fastest way to start contributing might be with **GitHub Codespaces**.\nYou start by forking the repository. You can then launch a codespace by clicking\n\n[![Open in Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-Codespaces-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/codespaces)\n\nThis will launch a github codespace (there is a free tier for 60h a month, thank you github!).\n\nIf you run\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\n# set up env and install dependencies\npixi install -e dev\n# compile rust dependencies\npixi run -e dev maturin-develop\n```\n`pixi` will install the development environment and all dependencies.\n\nNow, create a new Python script `debug.py` at the root of the repository and\npaste the following:\n\n::: {#e1bef596 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pyfixest as pf\n\ndata = pf.get_data()\nfit = pf.feols(\"Y ~ X1\", data=data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n\n            <div id=\"KjyVjt\"></div>\n            <script type=\"text/javascript\" data-lets-plot-script=\"library\">\n                if(!window.letsPlotCallQueue) {\n                    window.letsPlotCallQueue = [];\n                }; \n                window.letsPlotCall = function(f) {\n                    window.letsPlotCallQueue.push(f);\n                };\n                (function() {\n                    var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    script.type = \"text/javascript\";\n                    script.src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/JetBrains/lets-plot@v4.7.3/js-package/distr/lets-plot.min.js\";\n                    script.onload = function() {\n                        window.letsPlotCall = function(f) {f();};\n                        window.letsPlotCallQueue.forEach(function(f) {f();});\n                        window.letsPlotCallQueue = [];\n                        \n                    };\n                    script.onerror = function(event) {\n                        window.letsPlotCall = function(f) {};    // noop\n                        window.letsPlotCallQueue = [];\n                        var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n                        div.style.color = 'darkred';\n                        div.textContent = 'Error loading Lets-Plot JS';\n                        document.getElementById(\"KjyVjt\").appendChild(div);\n                    };\n                    var e = document.getElementById(\"KjyVjt\");\n                    e.appendChild(script);\n                })()\n            </script>\n            \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n\n            <div id=\"K3awZ7\"></div>\n            <script type=\"text/javascript\" data-lets-plot-script=\"library\">\n                if(!window.letsPlotCallQueue) {\n                    window.letsPlotCallQueue = [];\n                }; \n                window.letsPlotCall = function(f) {\n                    window.letsPlotCallQueue.push(f);\n                };\n                (function() {\n                    var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    script.type = \"text/javascript\";\n                    script.src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/JetBrains/lets-plot@v4.7.3/js-package/distr/lets-plot.min.js\";\n                    script.onload = function() {\n                        window.letsPlotCall = function(f) {f();};\n                        window.letsPlotCallQueue.forEach(function(f) {f();});\n                        window.letsPlotCallQueue = [];\n                        \n                    };\n                    script.onerror = function(event) {\n                        window.letsPlotCall = function(f) {};    // noop\n                        window.letsPlotCallQueue = [];\n                        var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n                        div.style.color = 'darkred';\n                        div.textContent = 'Error loading Lets-Plot JS';\n                        document.getElementById(\"K3awZ7\").appendChild(div);\n                    };\n                    var e = document.getElementById(\"K3awZ7\");\n                    e.appendChild(script);\n                })()\n            </script>\n            \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can now run the script by typing\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\npixi r -e dev python3 debug.py\n```\n\nor run unit tests\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\npixi run tests-regular\n```\n\nAfter changing the docs, you can build them by running\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\n# compile rust in docs environment\npixi run -e dev maturin-develop\n# build, render, preview docs\ndocs-build\ndocs-render\ndocs-preview\n```\n\nNote that the entire process might take a few minutes.\n\n## Reporting bugs\n\nWe use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues) to track bugs. You can report a bug by opening a new issue or contribute to an existing issue if\nrelated to the bug you are reporting.\n\nBefore creating a bug report, please check that your bug has not already been reported, and that your bug exists on the latest version of pyfixest. If you find a closed issue that seems to report the same bug you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in your issue description.\n\nPlease include as many details as possible in your bug report. The information helps the maintainers resolve the issue faster.\n\n## Suggesting enhancements\n\nWe use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) to track bugs and suggested enhancements. You can suggest an enhancement by opening a new feature request. Before creating an enhancement suggestion, please check that a similar issue does not already exist.\n\nPlease describe the behavior you want and why, and provide examples of how pyfixest would be used if your feature were added.\n\n## Contributing to the codebase\n\n### Setting up your local environment\n\nWould you like to contribute to pyfixest, or run some of the unit tests locally? Awesome!\nHere's how you can get started:\n\nFirst, you'll want to fork the pyfixest GitHub repository. Then, clone your forked repo with git:\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\ngit clone https://github.com/<username>/pyfixest.git\ncd pyfixest\n```\n\nTo work on pyfixest, you'll need Python and R installed. If you're planning to work on the documentation, be sure to have Quarto installed as well.\nNote: an R installation is only needed if you plan to run the unit tests locally.\n\nFor guidance on installing R and Python, check out the sections below.\n\n### Package Management via `pixi`\n\n\n`PyFixest` is using [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/).\n\nTo install `pixi`, just follow the [installation instructions](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation) from the `pixi` documentation.\n\nOnce `pixi` is installed, you can initialize the project environment and install all dependencies with\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\ncd path-to-pyfixest\npixi install\n```\n\nAfter installation, you can activate a custom `pixi` environment for `pyfixest` by typing:\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\npixi shell\n```\n\nYou'll now be in the `pixi` environment and ready to go!\n\nFor most development tasks, it’s best to activate the development environment since it includes all the necessary dependencies for development.\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\npixi shell --environment dev    # open the dev environment\n```\n\n### `Pixi` tasks\n\nTo help with development, we've included several handy pixi tasks.\n\nFor example, we use `ruff` and `pre-commit` to ensure code consistency across the project.\n\nTo run (and install) all pre-commit hooks, you can run\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\npixi run -e lint pre-commit\n```\n\nWe’ve included other tasks to help with testing. Almost all the necessary dependencies to run tests are included in the dev environment,\nexcept for R packages unavailable through conda-forge.\n\nIn a first step, we need to compile the provided Rust code, which we can do by running\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\npixi run -e dev maturin-develop\n```\n\nNote that you do not require a global Rust installation - we install Rust via conda!\n\nWe can then run all dev tasks:\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\n# attempt to install non-conda R dependencies\npixi run install-r-extended\n# run all tests via pytest\npixi run -e dev tests\n# run all tests excluding very computationally demanding tests or R-based tests\npixi run -e dev tests-regular\n# run all -e dev tests that depend on the extra R dependencies\n# rerun failed tests\npixi run -e dev tests-against-r-extended\npixi run -e dev tests-rerun\n```\n\nBuilding the documentation is also straightforward. We’ve got tasks to build, render, and preview the docs. As before,\nwe first need to compile the Rust extensions, this time in the docs env, by running\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\npixi run -e docs maturin-develop\n```\n\nThen we can build the documentation with quartodoc.\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\n# Build documentation and website\npixi run -e docs docs-build\n# render the docs\npixi run -e docs docs-render\n# preview the docs\npixi run -e docs docs-preview\n```\n\nKeep in mind that you’ll need quarto installed to build the documentation locally.\n\n## Installing Python, R and Quarto\n\n#### Installing Python\n\nThe minimal Python version to develop `pyfixest` is `3.9`. You can installed it on Mac/Linux via [Hombrew](https://brew.sh/):\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\nbrew install python@3.11 # specify the version of python you prefer\n```\n\nOn Windows via [Winget](https://winget.run/pkg/Python/Python.3.11):\n```{.bash .code-copy}\nwinget install -e --id Python.Python.3.11\n```\n\n### Installing R\n\nNote that R and R dependencies available through conda-forge are installed by pixi to the local project if you use the dev environment.\nSome extra R dependencies may require additional development tools not included in the environment, for example:\n\nDepending on your local set up, you may need to install additional libraries to compile those extra dependencies, like a version of `gcc` and `cmake`.\n\n### Installing Quarto\n\nDocumentation for `pyfixest` is written, compiled, and published using Quarto.\n\nTo install Quarto, run:\n\nOn MacOS via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/quarto#default):\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\nbrew install --cask quarto\n```\n\nOn Linux (Ubuntu using `gdebi`):\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\nsudo curl -o quarto-linux-amd64.deb -L <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/download/v${QUARTO_VERSION}/quarto-${QUARTO_VERSION}-linux-amd64.deb>\nsudo gdebi quarto-linux-amd64.deb\n```\n\nOn Windows:\n\n```{.bash .code-copy}\nscoop bucket add extras\nscoop install extras/quarto\n```\n\n",
