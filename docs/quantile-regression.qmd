PyFixest now experimentally supports quantile regression!

```{python}
%load_ext autoreload

import pyfixest as pf
import numpy as np
import time
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import itertools, time
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import math

data = pf.get_data()
```

## Basic Example

Just as in `statsmodels`, the function that runs a quantile regression is `quantreg()`.

Below, we loop over 10 different quantiles.

```{python}
%%capture
fits = [pf.quantreg("Y ~ X1 + X2 + f1", data = data, quantile = q) for q in np.arange(0.1, 1, 0.1)]
```

We can inspect the quantile regression results using the dedicated `qplot()` function.

```{python}
pf.qplot(fits, nrow = 2)
```

We observe some heterogeneity in the intercept, but all other variants are homogeneous across users.

## Solvers

By default, `pf.quantreg` uses an interior-point solver as in Koenker and Ng. For big data sets with many observations, it is often sensible to use an interior-point solver with pre-processing (as in Portnoy and Koenker, see Chernozhukov et al for details), which can speed up the estimation time significantly. Because the pre-processing step requires taking a random sample, the method assumes that observations are independent. Additionally, for the purpose of reproducibility, it is advisable to set a seed.

You can access the "preprocessing frisch-newton" algorithm by setting the `method` argument to `"pfn"`:

```{python}
%%capture
fit_fn = pf.quantreg(
  fml = "Y ~ X1",
  method = "fn",     # standard frisch newton interior point solver
  data = data,
)
fit_pfn = pf.quantreg(
  fml = "Y ~ X1",
  method = "pfn",   # standard frisch newton interior point solver with pre-processing
  seed = 92,         # set a seed for reproducibility
  data = data,
)

pf.etable([fit_fn, fit_pfn])
```

## Quantile Regression Process

Instead of running multiple independent quantile regression as in the first regression above, the literature on quantile regression has developed multiple algorithms to speed up the "quantile regression process". Two such algorithms are described in detail in Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val and Melly and are implemented in PyFixest. They can be accessed via the `multi_method` argument, and both can significantly speed up estimation time of the full quantile regression process.

```{python}
fml = "Y~X1"
method = "pfn"
seed = 929
quantiles = [0.1, 0.5, 0.9]

fit_multi1 = pf.quantreg(
  fml = fml,
  data = data,
  method = method,
  multi_method = "cfm1",
  seed = seed,
  quantile = quantiles,
)

fit_multi2 = pf.quantreg(
  fml = fml,
  data = data,
  method = method,
  multi_method = "cfm2",
  seed = seed,
  quantile = quantiles
)

pf.etable(fit_multi1.to_list() +  fit_multi2.to_list())
```

Note that the first method `cfm1` is exactly identical to running separate regressions per quantile, while the second method `cfm2` is only **asymptotically** identical.

You can combine different estimation `method`'s with different `multi_methods`:

```{python}
fit_multi2a = pf.quantreg(
  fml = "Y~X1",
  data = data,
  method = "fn",
  multi_method = "cfm1",
  seed = 233,
  quantile = [0.25, 0.75]
)

fit_multi2b = pf.quantreg(
  fml = "Y~X1",
  data = data,
  method = "pfn",
  multi_method = "cfm1",
  seed = 233,
  quantile = [0.25, 0.75]
)

pf.etable(fit_multi2a.to_list() +  fit_multi2b.to_list())

```

## Inference

`pf.quantreg` supports heteroskedasticity-robust inference ("nid") and cluster robust inference following
Parente & Santos Silva. See this [slide set](https://www.stata.com/meeting/uk15/abstracts/materials/uk15_santossilva.pdf)
or the [Journal of Econometrics paper](https://repository.essex.ac.uk/8976/1/dp728.pdf) for details.

```{python}
fit_nid = pf.quantreg("Y ~ X1 + X2 + f1", data = data, quantile = 0.5, vcov = "nid")
fit_crv = pf.quantreg("Y ~ X1 + X2 + f1", data = data, quantile = 0.5, vcov = {"CRV1": "f1"})
```
