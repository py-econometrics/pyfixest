PyFixest now experimentally supports quantile regression!

```{python}
%load_ext autoreload

import pyfixest as pf
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
import numpy as np

data = pf.get_data()
```

## Basic Example

Just as in `statsmodels`, the function that runs a quantile regression is `quantreg()`.

Below, we loop over 10 different quantiles.

```{python}
%%capture
fits = [pf.quantreg("Y ~ X1 + X2 + f1", data = data, quantile = q) for q in np.arange(0.1, 1, 0.1)]
```

We can inspect the quantile regression results using the dedicated `qplot()` function.

```{python}
pf.qplot(fits, nrow = 2)
```

We observe some heterogeneity in the Intercept, but all other variants are homogeneous across users.
