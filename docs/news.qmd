## PyFixest 0.14.0

- Moves the documentation to [quartodoc](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc).
- Changes all docstrings to `numpy` format.
- Difference-in-differences estimation functions now need to be imported via the `pyfixest.did.estimation` module:

```{python}
from pyfixest.did.estimation import did2s, lpdid, event_study
```
## PyFixest 0.13.5

- Fixes a bug that lead to incorrect results when the dependent variable and **all covariates** (excluding the fixed effects) where integers.

## PyFixest 0.13.4

- Fixes a bug in `etable()` with IV's that occurred because `feols()` does not report R2 statistics for IVs.

## PyFixest 0.13.2

- Fixes a bug in `etable()` and a warning in `fixest_model_matrix` that arose with higher `pandas` versions. Thanks to @aeturrell for reporting!

## PyFixest 0.13.0

### New Features

- Introduces a new `pyfixest.did` module which contains routines for Difference-in-Differences estimation.
- Introduces support for basic versions of the local projections DiD estimator following [Dube et al (2023)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31184)
- Adds a new vignette for Difference-in-Differences estimation.
- Reports R2 values in `etable()`.


## PyFixest 0.12.0


### Enhancements:

- Good performance improvements for singleton fixed effects detection. Thanks to [@styfenschaer](https://github.com/styfenschaer) for the PR! See [#229](https://github.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest/issues/229).
- Uses the [r2u project](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u) for installing R and R packages on github actions, with great performance improvements.
- Allows to pass `polars` data frames to `feols()`, `fepois()` and `predict()`. [#232](https://github.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest/issues/232). Thanks to [@vincentarelbundock](https://github.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest/issues/232) for the suggestion!

### Bug Fixes:

- Missing variables in features were not always handled correctly in `predict()` with `newdata` not `None` in the presence of missing data, which would lead to an error. See [#246](https://github.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest/issues/246) for details.
- Categorical variables were not always handled correctly in `predict()` with `newdata` not `None`, because the number of fixed effects levels in `newdata` might be smaller than in `data`. In consequence, some levels were not found, which lead to an error. See [#245](https://github.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest/issues/245) for details. Thanks to [@jiafengkevinchen](https://github.com/jiafengkevinchen) for the pointer!
- Multicollinearity checks for over-identified IV was not implemented correctly, which lead to a dimension error. See [#236](https://github.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest/issues/236) for details.  Thanks to [@jiafengkevinchen](https://github.com/jiafengkevinchen) for the pointer!
- The number of degrees of freedom `k` was computed incorrectly if columns were dropped from the design matrix `X` in the presence of multicollinearity. See [#235](https://github.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest/issues/235) for details.  Thanks to [@jiafengkevinchen](https://github.com/jiafengkevinchen) for the pointer!
- If all variables were dropped due to multicollinearity, an unclear and imprecise error message was produced. See [#228](https://github.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest/issues/228) for details. Thanks to [@manferdinig](https://github.com/manferdinig) for the pointer!
- If selection `fixef_rm = 'singleton'`, `feols()` and `fepois()` would fail, which has been fixed. [#192](https://github.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest/issues/192)

### Dependency Requirements

- For now, sets `formulaic` versions to be `0.6.6` or lower as version `1.0.0` seems to have introduced a problem with the `i()` operator, See [#244](https://github.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest/issues/244) for details.
- Drops dependency on `pyhdfe`.

## PyFixest 0.11.1

- Fixes some bugs around the computation of R-squared values (see [issue #103](https://github.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest/issues/103)).
- Reports R-squared values again when calling `.summary()`.

## PyFixest 0.11.0

- Significant speedups for CRV1 inference.

## PyFixest 0.10.12

## PyFixest 0.10.9

Makes `etable()` prettier and more informative.

## PyFixest 0.10.8

### Breaking changes
Reference levels for the `i()` formula syntax can no longer be set within the formula, but need to be added via the `i_ref1` function argument to either `feols()` and `fepois()`.

### New feature

A `dids2()` function is added, which implements the 2-stage difference-in-differences procedure Ã  la Gardner and follows the syntax of @kylebutts [did2s](https://github.com/kylebutts/did2s) R package.

```py
from pyfixest.did.did import did2s
from pyfixest.estimation import feols
from pyfixest.visualize import iplot
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df_het = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3alfisc/pyfixest/master/pyfixest/did/data/df_het.csv")

fit = did2s(
    df_het,
    yname = "dep_var",
    first_stage = "~ 0 | state + year",
    second_stage = "~i(rel_year)",
    treatment = "treat",
    cluster = "state",
    i_ref1 = [-1.0, np.inf],
)

fit_twfe = feols(
    "dep_var ~ i(rel_year) | state + year",
    df_het,
    i_ref1 = [-1.0, np.inf]
)

iplot([fit, fit_twfe], coord_flip=False, figsize = (900, 400), title = "TWFE vs DID2S")
```

## PyFixest 0.10.7

- Adds basic support for event study estimation via two-way fixed effects and Gardner's two-stage "Did2s" approach.
  This is a beta version and experimental. Further updates (i.e. proper event studies vs "only" ATTs) and a more flexible
  did2s front end will follow in future releases.

```python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2

from pyfixest.did.did import event_study
import pyfixest as pf
import pandas as pd
df_het = pd.read_csv("pyfixest/did/data/df_het.csv")

fit_twfe = event_study(
    data = df_het,
    yname = "dep_var",
    idname= "state",
    tname = "year",
    gname = "g",
    estimator = "twfe"
)

fit_did2s = event_study(
    data = df_het,
    yname = "dep_var",
    idname= "state",
    tname = "year",
    gname = "g",
    estimator = "did2s"
)

pf.etable([fit_twfe, fit_did2s])
# | Coefficient   | est1             | est2             |
# |:--------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
# | ATT           | 2.135*** (0.044) | 2.152*** (0.048) |
# Significance levels: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
```

  which leads to performance improvements of 5x or more:

```python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2

import numpy as np
import time
import pyhdfe
from pyfixest.demean import demean

np.random.seed(1238)
N = 10_000_000
x = np.random.normal(0, 1, 10*N).reshape((N,10))
f1 = np.random.choice(list(range(1000)), N).reshape((N,1))
f2 = np.random.choice(list(range(1000)), N).reshape((N,1))

flist = np.concatenate((f1, f2), axis = 1)
weights = np.ones(N)

algorithm = pyhdfe.create(flist)

start_time = time.time()
res_pyhdfe = algorithm.residualize(x)
end_time = time.time()
print(end_time - start_time)
# 26.04527711868286


start_time = time.time()
res_pyfixest, success = demean(x, flist, weights, tol = 1e-10)
# Calculate the execution time
end_time = time.time()
print(end_time - start_time)
#4.334428071975708

np.allclose(res_pyhdfe , res_pyfixest)
# True
```

- Fixes a few minor bugs in plotting and the `fixef()` method.


## PyFixest 0.9.1

### Breaking API changes

It is no longer required to initiate an object of type `Fixest` prior to running [Feols(/reference/Feols.qmd) or `fepois`. Instead,
you can now simply use `feols()` and `fepois()` as functions, just as in `fixest`. Both function can be found in an
`estimation` module and need to obtain a `pd.DataFrame` as a function argument:

```py
from pyfixest.estimation import fixest, fepois
from pyfixest.utils import get_data

data = get_data()
fit = feols("Y ~ X1 | f1", data = data, vcov = "iid")
```

Calling `feols()` will return an instance of class [Feols(/reference/Feols.qmd), while calling `fepois()` will return an instance of class `Fepois`.
Multiple estimation syntax will return an instance of class `FixestMulti`.

Post processing works as before via `.summary()`, `.tidy()` and other methods.

### New Features

A summary function allows to compare multiple models:

```py
from pyfixest.summarize import summary
fit2 = feols("Y ~ X1 + X2| f1", data = data, vcov = "iid")
summary([fit, fit2])
```

Visualization is possible via custom methods (`.iplot()` & `.coefplot()`), but a new module allows to visualize
  a list of [Feols(/reference/Feols.qmd) and/or `Fepois` instances:

```py
from pyfixest.visualize import coefplot, iplot
coefplot([fit, fit2])
```

The documentation has been improved (though there is still room for progress), and the code has been cleaned up a
bit (also lots of room for improvements).
