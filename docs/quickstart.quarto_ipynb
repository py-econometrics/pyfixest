        "## What is a fixed effect model?\n",
        "\n",
        "A fixed effect model is a statistical model that includes fixed effects, which are parameters that are estimated to be constant across different groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example [Panel Data]:** In the context of panel data, fixed effects are parameters that are constant across different individuals or time. The typical model example is given by the following equation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "Y_{it} = \\beta X_{it} + \\alpha_i + \\psi_t + \\varepsilon_{it}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $Y_{it}$ is the dependent variable for individual $i$ at time $t$, $X_{it}$ is the independent variable, $\\beta$ is the coefficient of the independent variable, $\\alpha_i$ is the individual fixed effect, $\\psi_t$ is the time fixed effect, and $\\varepsilon_{it}$ is the error term. The individual fixed effect $\\alpha_i$ is a parameter that is constant across time for each individual, while the time fixed effect $\\psi_t$ is a parameter that is constant across individuals for each time period.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note however that, despite the fact that fixed effects are commonly used in panel setting, one does not need a panel data set to work with fixed effects. For example, cluster randomized trials with cluster fixed effects, or wage regressions with worker and firm fixed effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this \"quick start\" guide, we will show you how to estimate a fixed effect model using the `PyFixest` package. We do not go into the details of the theory behind fixed effect models, but we focus on how to estimate them using `PyFixest`.\n",
