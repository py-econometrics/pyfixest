## Read Sample Data

In a first step, we load the module and some synthetic example data:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from lets_plot import LetsPlot

import pyfixest as pf
from pyfixest.did.estimation import did2s
from pyfixest.did.event_study import event_study

LetsPlot.setup_html()

plt.style.use("seaborn-v0_8")

%load_ext watermark
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = "retina"
%watermark --iversions

data = pf.get_data()
data.head()
```

```{python}
data.info()
```

We see that some of our columns have missing data.

## OLS Estimation

We are interested in the relation between the dependent variable `Y` and the independent variables `X1` using a fixed effect model for `group_id`. Let's see how the data looks like:

```{python}
ax = data.plot(kind="scatter", x="X1", y="Y", c="group_id", colormap="viridis")
```

We can estimate a fixed effects regression via the `feols()` function. `feols()` has three arguments: a two-sided model formula, the data, and optionally, the type of inference.

```{python}
fit = pf.feols(fml="Y ~ X1 | group_id", data=data, vcov="HC1")
type(fit)
```

The first part of the formula contains the dependent variable and "regular" covariates, while the second part contains fixed effects.

`feols()` returns an instance of the `Fixest` class.
