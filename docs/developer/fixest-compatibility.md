# Fixest compatibility

R `fixest` is the default behavioral reference for overlapping pyfixest
features. Match its user-facing names, defaults, formula behavior, estimates,
and inference unless there is a documented reason not to.

An intentional difference is complete only when it has:

- a precise statement of both behaviors;
- a user or architectural rationale;
- an external reference version;
- permanent tests for the chosen pyfixest behavior and the observed difference;
- human-maintainer review.

Newly observed discrepancies are not automatically intentional. Open or link an
issue and investigate them before adding them to this ledger.

## Compatibility ledger

| Area | Pyfixest behavior | `fixest` behavior | Rationale | Tests | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gaussian GLM inference | `feglm(family="gaussian")` matches `feols()`, base R `lm`, and base R `glm` for OLS behavior and small-sample corrections. | `fixest::feglm(family="gaussian")` applies GLM small-sample corrections that differ slightly from `fixest::feols`. | A Gaussian identity-link model should agree with pyfixest OLS and base R's Gaussian linear-model behavior. | `tests/test_feols_feglm_internally.py`; `tests/test_vs_fixest.py` | Intentional; documented for 0.70.0 |

## Adding an entry

Add an entry in the same PR that introduces or formalizes the difference. Name
the exact external package version in the test or its reference artifact. Link
the issue or decision record when the rationale is too large for the table.

Compatibility work that restores parity should update or remove the ledger
entry and retain a regression test.

The [fixest-first reference harness](reference-harness.md) provides a normalized
diagnostic comparison for overlapping `feols` and `fepois` behavior. Passing
the harness does not replace the permanent test linked from this ledger.
