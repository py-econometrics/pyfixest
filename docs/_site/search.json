Testing statistical and econometric models is implement using Python and R. Documents are written with Quarto and Jupyter.\nStart by forking the pyfixest GitHub repository, then clone your forked repository using git:\ngit clone https://github.com/<username>/pyfixest.git\ncd pyfixest\nIn order to work of pyfixest, you will need Python and R installed. If working on documentation, you will need Quarto installed.\nThere are multiple ways of installing Python and R, but if you need to install them prior to development the following are potential options:\n\n\nOn Mac/Linux via Hombrew:\nbrew install python@3.11 # specify the version of python you prefer\nOn Windows via Winget:\nwinget install -e --id Python.Python.3.11\n\n\n\n\nOn Mac/Linux:\nbrew install r\nDepending on your local set up, you may need to install additional libraries, for example:\nsudo apt install gcc-11 cmake\nOn Windows using Winget:\nwinget install -e --id RProject.R\nTests run with R require the following packages: - base - broom - clubSandwich - did2s - fixest - stats\nRscript -e 'install.packages(c(\"broom\", \"clubSandwich\", \"did2s\", \"fixest\"), repos=\"https://cran.rstudio.com\")'\nDocumentation for pyfixest is written, compiled, and published using Quarto.\nTo install Quarto, run:\nOn MacOS via Homebrew:\nbrew install --cask quarto\nOn Linux (Ubuntu using gdebi):\nsudo curl -o quarto-linux-amd64.deb -L <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/download/v${QUARTO_VERSION}/quarto-${QUARTO_VERSION}-linux-amd64.deb>\nsudo gdebi quarto-linux-amd64.deb\nOn Windows:\nscoop bucket add extras\nscoop install extras/quarto\n\n\n\nThere are several command line targets that assist with development included in the justfile. Just can be installed to help run these command line targets.\nOn Mac/Linux via Homebrew:\nbrew install just\nOn Windows:\nscoop bucket add main\nscoop install main/just"
