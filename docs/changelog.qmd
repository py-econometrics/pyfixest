```{python}
import pyfixest as pf
from pyfixest.report.utils import rename_categoricals

df = pf.get_data()

fit1 = pf.feols("Y ~ X1", data = df)

```

## PyFixest 0.30.0

### New Features

- We have created a **Rust** backend for all performance critical algorithms, with pretty great performance improvements! You can use the Rust backend by setting `demeaner_options = "rust"`.

We find pretty great performance improvements and want to make the Rust backend the default in PyFixest 0.31.0.

To back up the performance claim, here is a benchmark:

```{python}
import pyfixest as pf
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import time

rng = np.random.default_rng(737)

N = 10_000_000
benchmark_data = pd.DataFrame({
  "Y": rng.normal(0, 1, N),
  "X1": rng.normal(0, 1, N),
  "X2": rng.normal(0, 1, N),
  "X3": rng.normal(0, 1, N),
  "f1": rng.integers(0, 10_000, N),
  "f2": rng.integers(0, 1_000, N),
  "f3": rng.integers(0, 10, N),
})

# burn-in for numba
fit_nb_warmup = pf.feols(
  fml = "Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3 | f1 + f2 + f3", data = benchmark_data[:100_000]
)

# benchmark for numba backend
tic = time.time()
fit_nb = pf.feols(
  fml = "Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3 | f1 + f2 + f3", data = benchmark_data
)
toc = time.time()
print(f"Numba backend took {toc-tic}.")

# benchmark for rust backend
tic = time.time()
fit_rust = pf.feols(
  fml = "Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3 | f1 + f2 + f3", data = benchmark_data,
  demeaner_backend = "rust"
)
toc = time.time()
print(f"Rust backend took {toc-tic}.")
```

Results are also matching =)

```{python}
pf.etable([fit_nb, fit_rust], digits = 8)
```

- We now support **quantile regression**, including a Frisch-Newton Interior Point Solver with and without preprocessing, iid, heteroskedastic and cluster robust standard errors, fast algorithms for the entire quantile regression process, and some visualisations. In particular the algorithms for the quantile regression process show excellent performance. You can
learn more about all features and take a look at more systematic benchmarks in the [quantreg vignette](https://py-econometrics.github.io/pyfixest/quantile-regression.html).

```{python}
N_qr = 100_000
rng = np.random.default_rng(929)

df_qr = pd.DataFrame({
  "X1": rng.normal(0, 1, N_qr),
  "X2": rng.normal(0, 1, N_qr)
})
df_qr["Y"] = -0.5 + -2 * df_qr["X1"] + 1.9 * df_qr["X1"] ** 4 + df_qr["X2"] - 0.4 * df_qr["X2"] **7 + rng.normal(0, 1, N_qr)

tic = time.time()
fit_qr = pf.quantreg(
  fml = "Y ~ X1 + X2",
  data = df_qr,
  quantile = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
  method = "pfn",
  multi_method = "cfm2"
)
toc = time.time()
print(f"Fit the entire quantile regression process with {N_qr} obs and k = 3 in {np.round(toc-tic)} seconds.")

pf.qplot(fit_qr, figsize = [7,3])
```

- We have switched the **default solver** to `scipy.linalg.solve()`: [link](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/pull/904)

- You can now set the **maximum number of iterations** for the demeaning algo via a `fixef_maxiter` argument: [link](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/pull/944)

### Bug Fixes

- We fixed a bug in internal renaming of categoricals: [link](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/pull/886)
- We fixed a bug in etable arguments [link](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/pull/889)
- We stopped casting dependent variable to integer to void Information Loss in Poisson Regression: [link](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/pull/900)

- We improved the documentation on how to relabel variable names in the plotting and etable functions: [link](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/pull/895)

## Infrastructure

- We have reorganized our tests and rely more on conda environments for making R package test dependencies available: [link](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/pull/906)

### Community

- We have added a Code of Conduct.
- We have opened our discord community. Please join us there to discuss pyfixest and other py-econometrics projects! Link [here](https://discord.com/invite/gBAydeDMVK).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/compare/v0.29.0...v0.30.0

## PyFixest 0.29.0

- We add options `fixef_k = "nested"` and `fixef_k = "full"` for computing small sample corrections via `pf.ssc()`. We set the defaults for `pf.feols()` and other estimation functions to `fixef_k = "nested"` to 100% mimic the defaults of `r-fixest`. This is a "breaking change" in the sense that it might (slightly) impact the standard errors of your estimations.
- We add support for fully saturated event study estimation via the `SaturatedEventStudy` class, which can be called via `pf.event_study()`.
- We add support for difference-in-differences specification tests following Lal (2025).
- We add R2-within values to the default `etable()` output.
- We fix a small bug in the Gelbach `decompose()` method, which would fail if a user selected `only_coef = True`.
- The `decompose()` method runs fully on sparse matrices, which leads to large performance improvements on big data sets.
- We fix a small bug in the `predict()` method with `newdata`, see [here](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/840) for details.
- We add a function argument `rename_models` to help rename model names in the `coefplot()` and `iplot()` functions and methods:
  ```{python}
  pf.coefplot(
      models = [fit1, fit2, fit3],
      rename_models = {
          fit1._model_name_plot: "Model 1",
          fit2._model_name_plot: "Model 2",
          fit3._model_name_plot: "Model 3"
      },
  )
  ```
- Made `lets-plot` an optional dependency. The package will now fall back to `matplotlib` for plotting if `lets-plot` is not installed. Users can install `lets-plot` with `pip install pyfixest[plots]`.
- PyFixest now supports R2, adjusted R2, and within-R2 values for WLS (it previously only did for OLS, if at all).
- We add support for standard error of predictions for OLS models without fixed effects. As a default, the predict model still returns a `np.ndarray`. If the argument `se_fit` is set to
  `True`, we report the prediction standard errors. If argument `interval = "prediction"`, we return a `pd.DataFrame` with predictions, their standard errors, and confidence intervals.

## PyFixest 0.28.0

### New features and bug fixes
- Adds a function argument `context`, that allows to pass information / context to the `formulaic.Formulaic.get_model_matrix()` call that creates the model matrix.
- Fix a bug that caused reindexing of `LPDID._coeftable` when calling `LPDID.iplot()`. As a result, a second call of `LPDID.iplot()` would fail.
- Bumps the required `formulaic` version to `1.1.0` and fixes errors that arose when a) the ref argument was used for i() syntax, which led to a silent failure under formulaic >= 1.1.0, and fixef() / predict() with fixed effects, which led to a loud error.

### New experimental Features
- Adds a `pf.feglm()` function that supports GLMs with normal and binomial families (gaussian, logit, probit) without fixed effects. Fixed effects support is work in progress.
- Adds options to run the demean function via JAX. This might speed up the model fit if GPU is available.


## PyFixest 0.27.0

- Adds support for Gelbach's (JoLe 2016) Regression Decomposition method using a `decompose()` method for `Feols`.
- Adds support for the multiple hypothesis correction by Westfall & Young via the `pf.wyoung()` function.
- Input data frames to `pf.feols()` and `pf.fepois()` are now converted to `pandas` via [narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals).
  As a result, users can not provide `duckdb` or `ibis` tables as inputs, as well as `pandas` and `polars` data frames. `polars` and `pyarrow`
  are dropped as a dependencies.
- Fixes a bug in the `wildboottest` method, which incorrectly used to run a regression on the demeaned dependend variable in case it was
  applied after a fixed effects regression. My apologies for that!
- Fixes a bug in the `ritest` method, which would use randomization inference coefficients instead of t-statistics, leading to incorrect results.
  This has consequences for the rwolf() function, which, in case of running ri-inference, would default to run the randomization-t. My apolgies!
- Adds a vignette on multiple testing corrections.
- Adds a vignette on Gelbach's regression decomposition.

### Infrastructure

- infrastructure: fix minor release drafter bugs @s3alfisc (#504)

## PyFixest 0.21.0

- Add support for randomization inference via the `ritest()` method:

```{python}
#| eval: False
import pyfixest as pf
data = pf.get_data()

fit = pf.feols("Y ~ X1", data = data)
fit.ritest(resampvar="X1=0", reps = 1000)
```

## PyFixest 0.20.0

- This version introduces MyPy type checks to the entire pyfixest codebase. Thanks to @juanitorduz for nudging me to get started with this =). It also fixes a handful of smaller bugs.

## PyFixest 0.19.0

- Fixes multiple smaller and larger performance regressions. The NYC-Taxi example regression now takes approximately 22 seconds to run (... if my laptopt is connected to a power charger)!

```{python}
#| eval: False

%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2

import duckdb
import time
import numpy as np
import pyfixest as pf

# %%
nyc = duckdb.sql(
    '''
    FROM 'C:/Users/alexa/Documents/nyc-taxi/**/*.parquet'
    SELECT
        tip_amount, trip_distance, passenger_count,
        vendor_id, payment_type, dropoff_at,
        dayofweek(dropoff_at) AS dofw
    WHERE year = 2012 AND month <= 3
    '''
    ).df()

# convert dowf, vendor_id, payment_type to categorical
tic = time.time()
nyc["dofw"] = nyc["dofw"].astype(int)
nyc["vendor_id"] = nyc["vendor_id"].astype("category")
nyc["payment_type"] = nyc["payment_type"].astype("category")
print(f"""
    I am convering columns of type 'objects' to 'categories' and 'int'data types outside
    of the regression, hence I am cheating a bit. This saves {np.round(time.time() - tic)} seconds.
    """
)
#    I am convering columns of type 'objects' to 'categories' and 'int'data types outside
#    of the regression, hence I am cheating a bit. This saves 7.0 seconds.

run = True
if run:

    # mock regression for JIT compilation
    fit = pf.feols(
        fml = "tip_amount ~ trip_distance + passenger_count | vendor_id + payment_type + dofw",
        data = nyc.iloc[1:10_000],
        copy_data = False,
        store_data = False
        )

    import time
    tic = time.time()
    fit = pf.feols(
        fml = "tip_amount ~ trip_distance + passenger_count | vendor_id + payment_type + dofw",
        data = nyc,
        copy_data = False, # saves a few seconds
        store_data = False # saves a few second
        )
    passed = time.time() - tic
    print(f"Passed time is {np.round(passed)}.")
    # Passed time is 22.
```

- Adds three new function arguments to `feols()` and `fepois()`: `copy_data`, `store_data`, and `fixef_tol`.
- Adds support for frequency weights with the `weights_type` function argument.
```{python}
import pyfixest as pf

data = pf.get_data(N = 10000, model = "Fepois")
df_weighted = data[["Y", "X1", "f1"]].groupby(["Y", "X1", "f1"]).size().reset_index().rename(columns={0: "count"})
df_weighted["id"] = list(range(df_weighted.shape[0]))

print("Dimension of the aggregated df:", df_weighted.shape)
print(df_weighted.head())

fit = pf.feols(
    "Y ~ X1 | f1",
    data = data
)
fit_weighted = pf.feols(
    "Y ~ X1 | f1",
    data = df_weighted,
    weights = "count",
    weights_type = "fweights"
)
pf.etable([fit, fit_weighted], coef_fmt = "b(se) \n (t) \n (p)")
```

- Bugfix: Wild Cluster Bootstrap Inference with Weights would compute unweighted standard errors. Sorry about that! WLS is not supported for the WCB.
- Adds support for CRV3 inference with weights.


## PyFixest 0.18.0

- Large Refactoring of Interal Processing of Model Formulas, in particular `FixestFormulaParser` and `model_matrix_fixest`. As a results, the code should be cleaner and more robust.
- Thanks to the refactoring, we can now bump the required `formulaic` version to the stable `1.0.0` release.
- The `fml` argument of `model_matrix_fixest` is deprecated. Instead, `model_matrix_fixest`
  now asks for a `FixestFormula`, which is essentially a dictionary with information on model
  specifications like a first stage formula (if applicable), dependent variables, fixed effects,
  etc.
- Additionally, `model_matrix_fixest` now returns a dictionary instead of a tuple.
- Brings back fixed effects reference setting via `i(var1, var2, ref)` syntax. Deprecates the `i_ref1`, `i_ref2` function arguments. I.e. it is again possible to e.g. run

```{python}
#| eval: False

import pyfixest as pf
data = pf.get_data()

fit1 = pf.feols("Y ~ i(f1, X2)", data=data)
fit1.coef()[0:8]
```
Via the `ref` syntax, via can set the reference level:
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#| eval: False
fit2 = pf.feols("Y ~ i(f1, X2, ref = 1)", data=data)
fit2.coef()[0:8]
```

## PyFixest 0.17.0

- Restructures the codebase and reorganizes how users can interact with the `pyfixest` API. It is now recommended to use `pyfixest` in the following way:

  ```{python}
  import numpy as np
  import pyfixest as pf
  data = pf.get_data()
  data["D"] = data["X1"] > 0
  fit = pf.feols("Y ~ D + f1", data = data)
  fit.tidy()
  ```

  The update should not inroduce any breaking changes. Thanks to [@Wenzhi-Ding](https://github.com/Wenzhi-Ding) for the PR!

- Adds support for simultaneous confidence intervals via a multiplier bootstrap. Thanks to [@apoorvalal](https://github.com/apoorvalal) for the contribution!

  ```{python}
  fit.confint(joint = True)
  ```

- Adds support for the causal cluster variance estimator by [Abadie et al. (QJE, 2023)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/138/1/1/6750017)
  for OLS via the `.ccv()` method.

  ```{python}
  fit.ccv(treatment = "D", cluster = "group_id")
  ```



## PyFixest 0.16.0

- Adds multiple quality of life improvements for developers, thanks to [NKeleher](https://github.com/NKeleher).
- Adds more options to customize `etable()` output thanks to [Wenzhi-Ding](https://github.com/Wenzhi-Ding).
- Implements Romano-Wolf and Bonferroni corrections for multiple testing in the `multcomp` module.

## PyFixest 0.15.

- Adds support for weighted least squares for `feols()`.
- Reduces testing time drastically by running tests on fewer random data samples. Qualitatively,
  the set of test remains identical.
- Some updates for future `pandas` compatibility.

## PyFixest 0.14.0

- Moves the documentation to [quartodoc](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc).
- Changes all docstrings to `numpy` format.
- Difference-in-differences estimation functions now need to be imported via the `pyfixest.did.estimation` module:

```{python}
from pyfixest.did.estimation import did2s, lpdid, event_study
```
## PyFixest 0.13.5

- Fixes a bug that lead to incorrect results when the dependent variable and **all covariates** (excluding the fixed effects) where integers.

## PyFixest 0.13.4

- Fixes a bug in `etable()` with IV's that occurred because `feols()` does not report R2 statistics for IVs.

## PyFixest 0.13.2

- Fixes a bug in `etable()` and a warning in `fixest_model_matrix` that arose with higher `pandas` versions. Thanks to @aeturrell for reporting!

## PyFixest 0.13.0

### New Features

- Introduces a new `pyfixest.did` module which contains routines for Difference-in-Differences estimation.
- Introduces support for basic versions of the local projections DiD estimator following [Dube et al (2023)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31184)
- Adds a new vignette for Difference-in-Differences estimation.
- Reports R2 values in `etable()`.


## PyFixest 0.12.0


### Enhancements:

- Good performance improvements for singleton fixed effects detection. Thanks to [@styfenschaer](https://github.com/styfenschaer) for the PR! See [#229](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/229).
- Uses the [r2u project](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u) for installing R and R packages on github actions, with great performance improvements.
- Allows to pass `polars` data frames to `feols()`, `fepois()` and `predict()`. [#232](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/232). Thanks to [@vincentarelbundock](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/232) for the suggestion!

### Bug Fixes:

- Missing variables in features were not always handled correctly in `predict()` with `newdata` not `None` in the presence of missing data, which would lead to an error. See [#246](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/246) for details.
- Categorical variables were not always handled correctly in `predict()` with `newdata` not `None`, because the number of fixed effects levels in `newdata` might be smaller than in `data`. In consequence, some levels were not found, which lead to an error. See [#245](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/245) for details. Thanks to [@jiafengkevinchen](https://github.com/jiafengkevinchen) for the pointer!
- Multicollinearity checks for over-identified IV was not implemented correctly, which lead to a dimension error. See [#236](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/236) for details.  Thanks to [@jiafengkevinchen](https://github.com/jiafengkevinchen) for the pointer!
- The number of degrees of freedom `k` was computed incorrectly if columns were dropped from the design matrix `X` in the presence of multicollinearity. See [#235](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/235) for details.  Thanks to [@jiafengkevinchen](https://github.com/jiafengkevinchen) for the pointer!
- If all variables were dropped due to multicollinearity, an unclear and imprecise error message was produced. See [#228](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/228) for details. Thanks to [@manferdinig](https://github.com/manferdinig) for the pointer!
- If selection `fixef_rm = 'singleton'`, `feols()` and `fepois()` would fail, which has been fixed. [#192](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/192)

### Dependency Requirements

- For now, sets `formulaic` versions to be `0.6.6` or lower as version `1.0.0` seems to have introduced a problem with the `i()` operator, See [#244](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/244) for details.
- Drops dependency on `pyhdfe`.

## PyFixest 0.11.1

- Fixes some bugs around the computation of R-squared values (see [issue #103](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/103)).
- Reports R-squared values again when calling `.summary()`.

## PyFixest 0.11.0

- Significant speedups for CRV1 inference.

## PyFixest 0.10.12

Fixes a small bug with the separation check for poisson regression #138.

## PyFixest 0.10.11

Fixes bugs with i(var1, var2) syntax introduced with PyFixest 0.10.10.

## PyFixest 0.10.10

Fixes a bug with variable interactions via `i(var)` syntax. See [issue #221](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/211).

## PyFixest 0.10.9

Makes `etable()` prettier and more informative.

## PyFixest 0.10.8

### Breaking changes
Reference levels for the `i()` formula syntax can no longer be set within the formula, but need to be added via the `i_ref1` function argument to either `feols()` and `fepois()`.

### New feature

A `dids2()` function is added, which implements the 2-stage difference-in-differences procedure à la Gardner and follows the syntax of @kylebutts [did2s](https://github.com/kylebutts/did2s) R package.

```py
from pyfixest.did.did import did2s
from pyfixest.estimation import feols
from pyfixest.visualize import iplot
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df_het = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/master/pyfixest/did/data/df_het.csv")

fit = did2s(
    df_het,
    yname = "dep_var",
    first_stage = "~ 0 | state + year",
    second_stage = "~i(rel_year)",
    treatment = "treat",
    cluster = "state",
    i_ref1 = [-1.0, np.inf],
)

fit_twfe = feols(
    "dep_var ~ i(rel_year) | state + year",
    df_het,
    i_ref1 = [-1.0, np.inf]
)

iplot([fit, fit_twfe], coord_flip=False, figsize = (900, 400), title = "TWFE vs DID2S")
```
![](figures/event_study.svg)



## PyFixest 0.10.7

- Adds basic support for event study estimation via two-way fixed effects and Gardner's two-stage "Did2s" approach.
  This is a beta version and experimental. Further updates (i.e. proper event studies vs "only" ATTs) and a more flexible
  did2s front end will follow in future releases.

```python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2

from pyfixest.did.did import event_study
import pyfixest as pf
import pandas as pd
df_het = pd.read_csv("pyfixest/did/data/df_het.csv")

fit_twfe = event_study(
    data = df_het,
    yname = "dep_var",
    idname= "state",
    tname = "year",
    gname = "g",
    estimator = "twfe"
)

fit_did2s = event_study(
    data = df_het,
    yname = "dep_var",
    idname= "state",
    tname = "year",
    gname = "g",
    estimator = "did2s"
)

pf.etable([fit_twfe, fit_did2s])
# | Coefficient   | est1             | est2             |
# |:--------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
# | ATT           | 2.135*** (0.044) | 2.152*** (0.048) |
# Significance levels: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
```

## PyFixest 0.10.6

- Adds an `etable()` function that outputs markdown, latex or a pd.DataFrame.

## PyFixest 0.10.5

- Fixes a big in IV estimation that would trigger an error. See [here](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/197) for details. Thanks to @aeturrell for reporting!

## PyFixest 0.10.4

- Implements a custom function to drop singleton fixed effects.
- Additional small performance improvements.

## PyFixest 0.10.3

- Allows for white space in the multiway clustering formula.
- Adds documentation for multiway clustering.

## PyFixest 0.10.2

- Adds support for two-way clustering.
- Adds support for CRV3 inference for Poisson regression.

## PyFixest 0.10.1

- Adapts the internal fixed effects demeaning criteron to match `PyHDFE's default.
- Adds Styfen as coauthor.

## PyFixest 0.10

- Multiple performance improvements.
- Most importantly, implements a custom demeaning algorithm in `numba` - thanks to Styfen Schaer (@styfenschaer),
  which leads to performance improvements of 5x or more:

```python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2

import numpy as np
import time
import pyhdfe
from pyfixest.demean import demean

np.random.seed(1238)
N = 10_000_000
x = np.random.normal(0, 1, 10*N).reshape((N,10))
f1 = np.random.choice(list(range(1000)), N).reshape((N,1))
f2 = np.random.choice(list(range(1000)), N).reshape((N,1))

flist = np.concatenate((f1, f2), axis = 1)
weights = np.ones(N)

algorithm = pyhdfe.create(flist)

start_time = time.time()
res_pyhdfe = algorithm.residualize(x)
end_time = time.time()
print(end_time - start_time)
# 26.04527711868286


start_time = time.time()
res_pyfixest, success = demean(x, flist, weights, tol = 1e-10)
# Calculate the execution time
end_time = time.time()
print(end_time - start_time)
#4.334428071975708

np.allclose(res_pyhdfe , res_pyfixest)
# True
```



## PyFixest 0.9.11

- Bump required `formulaic` version to `0.6.5`.
- Stop copying the data frame in `fixef()`.

## PyFixest 0.9.10

- Fixes a big in the `wildboottest` method (see [#158](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/158)).
- Allows to run a wild bootstrap after fixed effect estimation.

## PyFixest 0.9.9

- Adds support for `wildboottest` for Python `3.11`.

## PyFixest 0.9.8

- Fixes a couple more bugs in the `predict()` and `fixef()` methods.
- The `predict()` argument `data` is renamed to `newdata`.

## PyFixest 0.9.7

Fixes a bug in `predict()` produced when multicollinear variables are dropped.

## PyFixest 0.9.6

Improved Collinearity handling. See [#145](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues/145)

## PyFixest 0.9.5


- Moves plotting from `matplotlib` to `lets-plot`.
- Fixes a few minor bugs in plotting and the `fixef()` method.


## PyFixest 0.9.1

### Breaking API changes

It is no longer required to initiate an object of type `Fixest` prior to running [Feols(/reference/Feols.qmd) or `fepois`. Instead,
you can now simply use `feols()` and `fepois()` as functions, just as in `fixest`. Both function can be found in an
`estimation` module and need to obtain a `pd.DataFrame` as a function argument:

```py
from pyfixest.estimation import fixest, fepois
from pyfixest.utils import get_data

data = get_data()
fit = feols("Y ~ X1 | f1", data = data, vcov = "iid")
```

Calling `feols()` will return an instance of class [Feols(/reference/Feols.qmd), while calling `fepois()` will return an instance of class `Fepois`.
Multiple estimation syntax will return an instance of class `FixestMulti`.

Post processing works as before via `.summary()`, `.tidy()` and other methods.

### New Features

A summary function allows to compare multiple models:

```py
from pyfixest.summarize import summary
fit2 = feols("Y ~ X1 + X2| f1", data = data, vcov = "iid")
summary([fit, fit2])
```

Visualization is possible via custom methods (`.iplot()` & `.coefplot()`), but a new module allows to visualize
  a list of [Feols(/reference/Feols.qmd) and/or `Fepois` instances:

```py
from pyfixest.visualize import coefplot, iplot
coefplot([fit, fit2])
```

The documentation has been improved (though there is still room for progress), and the code has been cleaned up a
bit (also lots of room for improvements).
