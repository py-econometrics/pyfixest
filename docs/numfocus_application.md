6. Does your project have a logo? This question is required.*

Yes.

7. Please upload a .svg file of your project's logo.This question is required.*.

upload.

8. Your project's Twitter handle or other social media handles/urls:

None.

9. Why do you want your project to join NumFOCUS?This question is required.*

We would like to join NumFocus because we want to push PyFixest to the next level. We believe that we will benefit from being part of the NumFocus network for it's experience in professionalising and maintaining scientific open source software. Additionally, we regularly work with university students with an interest in open source and econometrics and would like to offer them to participate in google summer of code.

10. Are you applying for Fiscal Sponsorship or Affiliation?This question is required.*

We apply for affiliation.

11. How does your project relate to or integrate with the existing ecosystem of NumFOCUS tools?This question is required.*

We heavily rely on the core scientific Python ecosystem: pandas for handling of data frames, numpy, scipy and numba for (array) computation, matplotlib for visualition. Of all projects affiliated with NumFocus, PyFixest is closest in spirit to statsmodels, with a stronger emphasis on performance and a focus on modern regression tools for applied econometric research.

12. Describe how your project furthers the NumFOCUS mission:This question is required.*

PyFixest advances the NumFOCUS mission by providing an open-source, high-performance alternative to proprietary econometric software, which is still widely used in economics/social science research. By integrating seamlessly with the scientific Python ecosystem, PyFixest enables large-scale, modern econometric research using free and community-driven tools. Additionally, it allows lecturers to teach modern econometric methods end-to-end in Python. This improves transparency, accessibility, and reproducibility in applied research. We also put a lot of effort in engaging students, fostering contributions to open-source software with a range of good first issues and regular pair-programming session with new contributors.

13. Please list your project's maintainers (i.e., anyone with write access to the repository). This question is required.*

15. What is your project doing to attract and/or mentor new contributors and maintainers?This question is required.*

We regularly talk about PyFixest at Python conferences (PyData Berlin 2024, Euroscipy 2024, PyData DE 2025) and openly invite new contributions! We actively maintain a "how to get started" guide and regularly organize pair-programming sessions in which we introduced interested new contributors to the code base (around 10). On top, we add good first issues on an ongoing basis and have set up a community-discord, in which we talk about PyFixest development.

16. Where do you host conversations about project development and governance (e.g. mailing lists, forums, etc.), and how many participants do you have?

We communicate in an open discord channel that is open to everyone and linked on top of the github repository.
