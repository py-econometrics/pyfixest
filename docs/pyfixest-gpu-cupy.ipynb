    "Besides JAX, it is possible to run PyFixest on the GPU via CuPy (linux and windows). Instead of applying the alternating projections algorithm to demean fixed effects, CuPy works with sparse matrices and the sparse LSMR solver (as is e.g. [available in scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr.html)).\n",

    "This strategy is amenable for GPU acceleration, and for problems where the standard demeaner struggles to converge, this strategy can lead to significant speedups if paired with a GPU.\n",
