## Overview

Thanks for showing interest in contributing to `pyfixest`! We appreciate all
contributions and constructive feedback, whether that be reporting bugs, requesting
new features, or suggesting improvements to documentation.

If you'd like to get involved, but are not yet sure how, please feel free to send us an [email](mailto:alexander-fischer1801@t-online.de). Some familiarity with
either Python or econometrics will help, but you really don't need to be a `numpy` core developer or have published in [Econometrica](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680262) =) We'd be more than happy to invest time to help you get started!

## PyFixest Sprint in Heilbronn

We're hosting a [PyFixest Sprint](pyfixest-sprint.md) with [AppliedAI](https://www.appliedai.de/) in late February/early March 2026. If you're interested in contributing to PyFixest in person, [learn more and get in touch](pyfixest-sprint.md)!
:::

For a comprehensive overview of the codebase architecture and internals, check out the [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest). While not perfect and correct in all regards, we think it is a pretty good starting point to learn about the codebase!

## Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

If you are new to open source / Python development, the fastest way to start contributing might be with **GitHub Codespaces**.
You start by forking the repository. You can then launch a codespace by clicking

[![Open in Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-Codespaces-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/codespaces)

This will launch a github codespace (there is a free tier for 60h a month, thank you github!).

If you run

```{.bash .code-copy}
# set up env and install dependencies
pixi install -e dev
# compile rust dependencies
pixi run -e dev maturin-develop
```
`pixi` will install the development environment and all dependencies.

Now, create a new Python script `debug.py` at the root of the repository and
paste the following:

```{python}
import pyfixest as pf

data = pf.get_data()
fit = pf.feols("Y ~ X1", data=data)
```

You can now run the script by typing

```{.bash .code-copy}
pixi r -e dev python3 debug.py
```

or run unit tests

```{.bash .code-copy}
pixi run tests-regular
```

After changing the docs, you can build them by running

```{.bash .code-copy}
# compile rust in docs environment
pixi run -e dev maturin-develop
# build, render, preview docs
docs-build
docs-render
docs-preview
```

Note that the entire process might take a few minutes.

## Reporting bugs

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues) to track bugs. You can report a bug by opening a new issue or contribute to an existing issue if
related to the bug you are reporting.

Before creating a bug report, please check that your bug has not already been reported, and that your bug exists on the latest version of pyfixest. If you find a closed issue that seems to report the same bug you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in your issue description.

Please include as many details as possible in your bug report. The information helps the maintainers resolve the issue faster.

## Suggesting enhancements

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) to track bugs and suggested enhancements. You can suggest an enhancement by opening a new feature request. Before creating an enhancement suggestion, please check that a similar issue does not already exist.

Please describe the behavior you want and why, and provide examples of how pyfixest would be used if your feature were added.

## Contributing to the codebase

### Setting up your local environment

Would you like to contribute to pyfixest, or run some of the unit tests locally? Awesome!
Here's how you can get started:

First, you'll want to fork the pyfixest GitHub repository. Then, clone your forked repo with git:

```{.bash .code-copy}
git clone https://github.com/<username>/pyfixest.git
cd pyfixest
```

To work on pyfixest, you'll need Python and R installed. If you're planning to work on the documentation, be sure to have Quarto installed as well.
Note: an R installation is only needed if you plan to run the unit tests locally.

For guidance on installing R and Python, check out the sections below.

### Package Management via `pixi`


`PyFixest` is using [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/).

To install `pixi`, just follow the [installation instructions](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation) from the `pixi` documentation.

Once `pixi` is installed, you can initialize the project environment and install all dependencies with

```{.bash .code-copy}
cd path-to-pyfixest
pixi install
```

After installation, you can activate a custom `pixi` environment for `pyfixest` by typing:

```{.bash .code-copy}
pixi shell
```

You'll now be in the `pixi` environment and ready to go!

For most development tasks, it’s best to activate the development environment since it includes all the necessary dependencies for development.

```{.bash .code-copy}
pixi shell --environment dev    # open the dev environment
```

### `Pixi` tasks

To help with development, we've included several handy pixi tasks.

For example, we use `ruff` and `pre-commit` to ensure code consistency across the project.

To run (and install) all pre-commit hooks, you can run

```{.bash .code-copy}
pixi run -e lint pre-commit
```

We’ve included other tasks to help with testing. Almost all the necessary dependencies to run tests are included in the dev environment,
except for R packages unavailable through conda-forge.

In a first step, we need to compile the provided Rust code, which we can do by running

```{.bash .code-copy}
pixi run -e dev maturin-develop
```

Note that you do not require a global Rust installation - we install Rust via conda!

We can then run all dev tasks:

```{.bash .code-copy}
# attempt to install non-conda R dependencies
pixi run install-r-extended
# run all tests via pytest
pixi run -e dev tests
# run all tests excluding very computationally demanding tests or R-based tests
pixi run -e dev tests-regular
# run all -e dev tests that depend on the extra R dependencies
# rerun failed tests
pixi run -e dev tests-against-r-extended
pixi run -e dev tests-rerun
```

Building the documentation is also straightforward. We’ve got tasks to build, render, and preview the docs. As before,
we first need to compile the Rust extensions, this time in the docs env, by running

```{.bash .code-copy}
pixi run -e docs maturin-develop
```

Then we can build the documentation with quartodoc.

```{.bash .code-copy}
# Build documentation and website
pixi run -e docs docs-build
# render the docs
pixi run -e docs docs-render
# preview the docs
pixi run -e docs docs-preview
```

Keep in mind that you’ll need quarto installed to build the documentation locally.

## Installing Python, R and Quarto

#### Installing Python

The minimal Python version to develop `pyfixest` is `3.9`. You can installed it on Mac/Linux via [Hombrew](https://brew.sh/):

```{.bash .code-copy}
brew install python@3.11 # specify the version of python you prefer
```

On Windows via [Winget](https://winget.run/pkg/Python/Python.3.11):
```{.bash .code-copy}
winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.11
```

### Installing R

Note that R and R dependencies available through conda-forge are installed by pixi to the local project if you use the dev environment.
Some extra R dependencies may require additional development tools not included in the environment, for example:

Depending on your local set up, you may need to install additional libraries to compile those extra dependencies, like a version of `gcc` and `cmake`.

### Installing Quarto

Documentation for `pyfixest` is written, compiled, and published using Quarto.

To install Quarto, run:

On MacOS via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/quarto#default):

```{.bash .code-copy}
brew install --cask quarto
```

On Linux (Ubuntu using `gdebi`):

```{.bash .code-copy}
sudo curl -o quarto-linux-amd64.deb -L <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/download/v${QUARTO_VERSION}/quarto-${QUARTO_VERSION}-linux-amd64.deb>
sudo gdebi quarto-linux-amd64.deb
```

On Windows:

```{.bash .code-copy}
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install extras/quarto
```
