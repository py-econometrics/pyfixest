## Coming Soon
This tutorial is under construction. It will cover Poisson regression for count data, logit/probit GLMs, marginal effects, and applications with patent counts and firm-year panels.
:::

For now, see the [Getting Started](../getting-started.qmd) guide for a quick Poisson example, and the [Function Reference](../reference/index.qmd) for detailed API documentation.
