## Coming Soon
This tutorial is under construction. It will cover IV estimation with fixed effects, first-stage diagnostics, the effective F-statistic, and applications inspired by compulsory schooling and A/B non-compliance.
:::

For now, see the [Getting Started](../getting-started.qmd) guide for a quick IV example, and the [Function Reference](../reference/index.qmd) for detailed API documentation.
