## Coming Soon
This tutorial is under construction. It will cover the `sw`, `sw0`, `csw`, `csw0` operators, multiple dependent variables, split/fsplit, and patterns for systematic specification testing.
:::

For now, see the [Getting Started](../getting-started.qmd) guide for a quick multiple estimation example, and the [Function Reference](../reference/index.qmd) for detailed API documentation.
